# SDL 2.0.18 docset

[SDL](http://libsdl.org) (v2.0.18) docset for [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash).

This docset has been generated by [superzazu](https://github.com/superzazu).

Previous versions of this docset were built by [Karl Larsaeus](https://github.com/karlll).

# How to build

1. Download [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.18.tar.gz)
2. Go to `docs` directory
3. Open `doxyfile` and update those values:

```
GENERATE_DOCSET   = YES
DISABLE_INDEX     = YES
SEARCHENGINE      = NO
GENERATE_TREEVIEW = NO
FULL_PATH_NAMES   = NO
```

4. Run `doxygen doxyfile`
5. Go to `output/html` and run `make`
6. Replace `Info.plist` file contents with:

```plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
    <string>org.libsdl.sdl20</string>
    <key>CFBundleName</key>
    <string>SDL</string>
    <key>DashDocSetFamily</key>
    <string>doxy</string>
    <key>DocSetPlatformFamily</key>
    <string>sdl</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Note: used [docsetutil](https://github.com/swiftdocorg/docsetutil) from swiftdocorg since Apple does not bundle `docsetutil` with Xcode anymore.
